/* Coding Challenge #1
Back to the two gymnastics teams, the Dolphins and the Koalas! There is a new gymnastics discipline, which works differently.
Each team competes 3 times, and then the average of the 3 scores is calculated (so one average score per team).
A team only wins if it has at least double the average score of the other team. Otherwise, no team wins!
Your tasks:
1. Create an arrow function 'calcAverage' to calculate the average of 3 scores
2. Use the function to calculate the average for both teams
3. Create a function 'checkWinner' that takes the average score of each team
as parameters ('avgDolhins' and 'avgKoalas'), and then logs the winner to the console, together with the victory points, according to the rule above. Example: "Koalas win (30 vs. 13)"
4. Use the 'checkWinner' function to determine the winner for both Data 1 and Data 2
5. Ignore draws this time
Test data:
Â§ Data 1: Dolphins score 44, 23 and 71. Koalas score 65, 54 and 49 Â§ Data 2: Dolphins score 85, 54 and 41. Koalas score 23, 34 and 27
Hints:
Â§ To calculate average of 3 values, add them all together and divide by 3
Â§ To check if number A is at least double number B, check for A >= 2 * B.
Apply this to the team's average scores ðŸ˜‰ GOOD LUCK ðŸ˜€ */

Steven is still building his tip calculator, using the same rules as before: Tip 15% of the bill if the bill value is between 50 and 300, and if the value is different, the tip is 20%.
Your tasks:
1. Write a function 'calcTip' that takes any bill value as an input and returns the corresponding tip, calculated based on the rules above (you can check out the code from first tip calculator challenge if you need to). Use the function type you like the most. Test the function using a bill value of 100
2. And now let's use arrays! So create an array 'bills' containing the test data below
3. Create an array 'tips' containing the tip value for each bill, calculated from the function you created before
4. Bonus: Create an array 'total' containing the total values, sothebill+tip Test data: 125, 555 and 44
Hint: Remember that an array needs a value in each position, and that value can actually be the returned value of a function! So you can just call a function as array values (so don't store the tip values in separate variables first, but right in the new array) ðŸ˜‰

1. Create an array containing all the neighbouring countries of a country of your choice. Choose a country which has at least 2 or 3 neighbours. Store the array into a variable called 'neighbours'
2. At some point, a new country called 'Utopia' is created in the neighbourhood of your selected country. So add it to the end of the 'neighbours' array
3. Unfortunately, after sometime, the new country is dissolved. So remove it from the end of the array
4. If the 'neighbours' array does not include the country â€˜Germanyâ€™, log to the console: 'Probably not a central European country :D'
5. Change the name of one of your neighbouring countries. To do that,find the index of the country in the 'neighbours' array, and then use that index to change the array at that index position. For example, you can search for 'Sweden' in the array, and then replace it with 'Republic of Sweden'. */

Your tasks:
1. Create an array 'bills' containing all 10 test bill values
2. Create empty arrays for the tips and the totals ('tips' and 'totals')
3. Use the 'calcTip' function we wrote before (no need to repeat) to calculate tips and total values (bill + tip) for every bill value in the bills array. Use a for loop to perform the 10 calculations!
Test data: 22, 295, 176, 440, 37, 105, 10, 1100, 86 and 52
Hints: Call â€˜calcTip â€˜in the loop and use the push method to add values to the
tips and totals arrays ðŸ˜‰ 
Bonus:
4. Bonus: Write a function 'calcAverage' which takes an array called 'arr' as an argument. This function calculates the average of all numbers in the given array. This is a difficult challenge (we haven't done this before)! Here is how to solve it:



4.1. First, you will need to add up all values in the array. To do the addition, start by creating a variable 'sum' that starts at 0. Then loop over the array using a for loop. In each iteration, add the current value to the 'sum' variable. This way, by the end of the loop, you have all values added together
4.2. To calculate the average, divide the sum you calculated before by the length of the array (because that's the number of elements)
4.3. Call the function with the 'totals' array
